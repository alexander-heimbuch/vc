Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! And then the battle's not so bad? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Soothe us with sweet lies. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I'm Santa Claus! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? It must be wonderful. Negative, bossy meat creature! Do a flip!

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
Soon enough.
So, how 'bout them Knicks? Also Zoidberg. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I wish! It's a nickel.

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.

File not found. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Soon enough. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

We're rescuing ya. Guess again. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

Large bet on myself in round one. With gusto. Say what? When will that be?

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Really?! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.

Who are you, my warranty?! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! File not found. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
