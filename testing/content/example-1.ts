  Also Zoidberg. When will that be? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Daylight and everything. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

  And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

  One hundred dollars.

  It must be wonderful. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

  Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.
  Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…
For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.
  But existing is basically all I do!

  She also liked to shut up! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Throw her in the brig. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

  Why would a robot need to drink?
  Shut up and take my money!
  Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!
  Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

  You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

  I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Ow, my spirit! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

  Then we'll go with that data file! I don't want to be rescued. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

  No argument here. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Moving along… Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Tell them I hate them. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

  Belligerent and numerous. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

  You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Yeah, lots of people did. A sexy mistake.

  This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I'll get my kit! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

  I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Who are those horrible orange men? Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Soon enough.

  I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. One hundred dollars. You know, I was God once.

  Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Leela's gonna kill me. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Kids have names?`;
