That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Ummm…to eBay? You're going to do his laundry? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

I don't want to be rescued. Oh God, what have I done? Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Is that a cooking show? Ummm…to eBay? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

It must be wonderful.
Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

What are their names? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why would I want to know that? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Who are you, my warranty?!

We're also Santa Claus!
Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?
Bender, quit destroying the universe!
Well, then good news! It's a suppository. We're also Santa Claus! I'm a thing. Kif might! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Ask her how her day was.

Then we'll go with that data file! Fatal. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Who are you, my warranty?! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Soon enough. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

Say it in Russian! No, just a regular mistake. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Soon enough. Say it in Russian! We're also Santa Claus!

I wish! It's a nickel. Throw her in the brig. I'm a thing. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I love you, buddy! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

No, she'll probably make me do it. No. We're on the top. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. You can see how I lived before I met you.

And until then, I can never die? You are the last hope of the universe. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I never loved you. You are the last hope of the universe. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. But I've never been to the moon! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
